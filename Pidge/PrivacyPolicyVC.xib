When We Collect Information
We collect the information provided to us through registration in the app, enquiries into our services, and participation in discussions within our platform. 
We also collect information automatically when our app is in use. This includes information about the device and the general location of the device. This allows us to provide services that have copyright restrictions or deliver locationally relevant news. We may also collect information from cookies place on the device with consent, allowing us to collect the specific location of the device or to request access to data from other applications.
Legal Basis
Content generated by interactions between customers or our staff may be displayed indefinitely in any relevant context, subject to our editorial judgement and the customer rights defined in this policy.
When our platform is in use, advertising networks and other intermediaries are able to select and display adverts on the device. These companies collect information from the device to help select adverts which they believe are most relevant and tell advertisers that ads have been delivered and seen. 
There are legal grounds that enable data processing, but usage of personal information by organizations requires a legal reason. These justifications may be customer consent, to fulfil a contract with the customer, to comply with legal obligations, or for a legitimate interest such as achieving our business objectives or to facilitate a benefit to one of our customers. These legitimate interests may only occur when fair and lawful.
How We Use Your Information
We use customer information to provide our services and manage user relationships. Customer information also allows us to monitor, improve, and protect our platform and provide support to our users. We are also able to provide more personalized content based on the way customers interact with our product.
We may also use cookies, code, script, or other technical means to check if a given internet browser allows adverts or if there is an ad blocker installed on said browser. In cases where third party adverts are displayed on our platform, they may collect and use personal information due to previous cookies in place and beyond our control. 
We may disclose customer information in response to police requests, regulatory inquiries, to enforce our rights or the rights of others, or for the detection and prevention of crimes. Further, users that engage in disruptive behavior on our platform may have their information shared to prevent further disruption such as by informing relevant third parties such as law enforcement. 
As part of the News Corp umbrella, information will be shared between News Corp business units as well as News Corp affiliates in cases where we have a compelling legitimate interest. 
Cookies
Cookies are small bits of data or code that identify your devices while you use and interact with our services. They help us to remember your preferences and identify popular features. We are unable to place and use cookies without customer explicit affirmative consent.
